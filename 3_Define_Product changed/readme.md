# Introduction

A device that performs logic and arithmetic digital operations based on numeric data which are entered by pressing numerical data which are entered by pressing numerical and control keys .

Also known as calculating machine.A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition,subtraction,multiplication and division. More sophisicated calcultors can handle exponential operations,factorial,logarithms,trignometric functions and hyperbolic functions.

## Defining system

- Provide operations for the user to select one at a time.
- Can be used to perform any process that consists of a sequence of steps each of which applies one of the operations including addition,subtraction,multiplication,division,modulus.
- Can do some of the advanced calculations which normal calculators can&#39;t do like finding the percentage of the number, exponential, prime number and factorial of a number.
